<a name="strategy"></a>
##  Strategy Plane
Our goal at this stage of the project is to identify what the customer aims to achieve, what their business goals are, and in turn, the reason for a website.

The scope is fundamentally determined by the strategy of the site, so it is important we define a good strategy from the outset. This strategy incorporates not only the benefit to the owners of the site but also the benefit to the users.

We aim to:
*   determine the business objectives and the value of the website
*   use this plane to determine the reason for the websites existence

<a name="randr"></a>
### Define roles and responsibilities
From here on **Divide of Everything** will be known as the client.

For the purposes of this project, Sonya Cooley will have full authority, primary responsibility, and full accountability for all aspects of the project. 
She will have a Mentor available to her at the beginning, middle and end of the project.

<a name="scope"></a>
##  Scope Plane
Our project scope will be based on our defined Strategy. We will;
*   determine the websites requirements
*   determine the websites key functionality
*   determine what features are to be included in this and possible future product releases

The client website will target fans and potential fans with their back catalogue and new material. The site will showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events, etc.

<a name="scenarios"></a>
### Scenarios
####    Client Fan:
A client fan will be a fan who is aware of the client for some time. They will be aware of the clients back catalogue of music and keep up to date with their new music.
A client fan will visit the site to listen to the clients back catalogue, read client news and lookup where and when future gigs will happen. A client fan may also wish to make an enquiry about booking the band for an event as they are aware of the type of gig the client performs.

####    New Client Fan:
A new client fan will visit the site to listen to new music that may have caught their attention. They will then listen to the clients back catalogue. A new client will be interested in the About Us content and will also be interested in where and when future gigs will happen.

####    Business User:
A business user may be aware of the client from corporate events or other business events. The business user is aware that the client attracts large audiences and has a good catalogue of music.
The business user will visit the site to look up when/where the clients next performances are and if the client is available, they will make an enquiry about booking the client via the booking enquiry form.


<a name="func"></a>
###    Functional Specifications
The site will provide users with access to the clients’ music catalogue and the ability to make an enquiry about booking the client for events.
The site will provide the ability to;
*   navigate between pages
*   listen to the clients’ catalogue of music 
*   make an enquiry about booking the client for events and
*   links to the clients social media.

The site will be optimised for latest version of Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera and optimised for mobile usage. HTML and CSS will be written using the Mobile-First approach. The mobile-first approach is designing for the smallest screen and working your way up to desktop screens.

[Top of page](#topofpage)
<a name="content"></a>
###    Content Requirements
Most screens/pages will follow a standard format, with a look and feel to be designed by a graphic designer. Each page will have a content area between a consistent header and footer.
The header will contain the client logo and navigation. 
The footer will contain links to the client’s social media sites.
  
All pages will be created using HTML5 and CSS3, provided by the Bootstrap Framework 4.
Content for the site will be provided by the client.

<a name="sitemap"></a>
####   SiteMap
![sitemap](md-images/sitemap.png)

|Page|Description|
|:---|:---|
|**Home Page**|The home page will consist of a hero image, a header containing a logo and navigation and a footer with links to other social media sites. The navigation will take users to other site pages while the logo will also be a link taking the user to the home page.|
|**About us**|The about us page will contain information about the client and a brief profile on each of the band members.|
|**Catalogue**|This page provides access to the clients’ music catalogue which is available on soundcloud. Music and videos will either be linked to or embedded on the page.|
|**News**|Providing information to users about client news and upcoming gigs|
|**Book us**|Provides the ability to make an enquiry about booking the client using a web form|

<a name="nav"></a>

|Logo|Takes user to home page|

<a name="sands"></a>
##  Structure & Skeleton Plane
Our goal for the Structure plane is to organise the information architecture and interactions for the site. We will keep a consistent, predictable, learnable interface, and, interactions. We will use industry standard technologies to implement expected behaviours when using the site, e.g. tooltips, navigation, including accessibility, etc.

Users will find the navigation at the top of the site in an expected location. The site will be intuitive and follow tried and trusted paths.

The form will follow user expectations where feedback is provided if user interactions are unexpected, incomplete or complete.

<a name="design"></a>
### Interaction design
The website will use a weblike organisational structure which will pose few restrictions on the pattern of information used. This structure works best for small sites.
The user will be presented with a consistent navigation along the top of every page.
Each navigation element will take the user to the same page e.g. ‘About us’ will take the user to the ‘About Us’ page regardless of what page the user is currently visiting.

The navigation will follow this order:
**Home – About us – Catalogue – News – Book Us** and the logo will also act as a link to the home page (index.html)

![weblike structure](md-images/weblike.png)

<a name="architecture"></a>
### Information architecture
The website will implement content in a standard tree structure. It will go to one level which will reduce complexity and ensure users do not have to exceed the three-click rule of thumb.

![sitemap](md-images/sitemap.png)

|![directory structure](md-images/dirstructure.png)|At the root of the site:<ul><li>Index.html</li><li>Aboutus.html</li><li>Catalogue.html</li><li>News.html</li><li>Bookus.html</li></ul>Assets Directory<ul><li>CSS sub-directory</li><li>Images sub-directory</li><li>Videos sub-directory</li><li>Audio sub-directory</li></ul>|

##  Surface Plane

<a name="dev"></a>
### Development Phase

<a name="ide"></a>
####    IDE
The website was developed using the Cloud9 IDE. 

Cloud9 IDE is an online integrated development environment, that supports hundreds of programming languages. 
It enables developers to get started with coding immediately with pre-configured workspaces, collaborate with their peers with collaborative coding features, 
and web development features like live preview and browser compatibility testing.

<a name="version"></a>
####    Version Control
Git was used to manage the source code for this project. Git is a version control system for tracking changes in project files.

Project files were committed to Git after each major functional addition, new page, update or implementation of testing results.
Following the initial commit to Git, each major update was followed by a Git add and commit. 
For example; after the header was completed, after the footer was completed and after each page was completed

__A full Git log can be provided on request.__

<a name="readmeheader"></a>
####    Readme
A Readme markdown file is provided with the site on GitHub. It explains what the project does and the need that it fulfils. 
It also describes the functionality of the site, as well as the technologies used. 
The Readme provides information on how the site was deployed and tested and if some of the work was based on other code.

A PDF version of the Readme is also provided: https://sonnerz.github.io/project01-user-centric-frontend/readme.pdf

[Top of page](#topofpage)
<a name="testing"></a>
####    Testing
The website was tested on an ongoing basis. Chrome and Chrome Developer Tools were the primary browser and tool used for testing. 
However, the site was also tested using Firefox and Internet Explorer.

*   HTML was validated using the Markup Validation Service provided by The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C): https://validator.w3.org/

*   CSS was validated using the CSS Validation Service provided by The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C): https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

During development:
*   The Body background colour had different colours for each media query to ensure the @media queries were being adapted by the browser.
*   Div’s had vibrant background colours so that the developer was easily able to identify them
*   Each change was viewed in a chrome browser and tested using developer tools at full width resolution and using a variety of device emulators; Galaxy SIII, Galaxy 5, Laptop touch screen, iPhone 5/SE, iPhone 6/7/8, iPhone 6/7/8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad.
*   Remote debugging using Android, Windows OS and Chrome Dev Tools were used to test each new functionality and new/updated page.
*   Each page was audited using Chrome Dev Tools Audit functionality
  
**PLEASE NOTE: Many of the issues highlighted by the Audit can be addressed by more advanced solutions that are beyond the scope of this HTML/CSS project.**

####    Usability Testing
During usability testing, it was found that the user had difficulty deciding what to do on the home page. 
As a result, an ‘Enter Site’ link was added to allow the user to navigate straight to the Catalogue page from the home page. 
A band logo was added to the global navigation bar in the mobile view to attract the user to the button navigation.

[Top of page](#topofpage)
<a name="html"></a>
####    HTML/CSS Structure
#####   Header
![Header](md-images/banner.png)
The header was developed/designed to be full width and contain the client logo and global navigation. The navigation is responsive to the type of client a user is using to view the site.
Any view below 768px wide will get a collapsing Navigation Bar. The navigation links will have a hover state making it obvious to users which navigation link they are hovering over.
The active link has a bold font, making it obvious to users which page they are visiting.
The collapsed navigation will have a similar hover state.

#####   Footer
![Footer](md-images/footer.png)
The footer was developed/designed to be full width and contain the client copyright notice and social media links.
The social media links will have an obvious hover state.

#####   Index Page
The index page was created using Bootstrap 4 cover page. A hero image of the band fills the screen with their logo overlayed. This was achieved using a transparent PNG file.
The user is first introduced to the navigation at the top of the page and the social media links in the footer. This is where the user will consistently find these throughout the site.

#####   About us Page
The about us page has two columns of content. The profile of each band member is held in a div and offset from each other in a zigzag pattern down the page. 
This makes the layout more interesting and keeps the user scrolling down the page. 
On smaller devices the two column layout becomes a single column and the user profiles appear stacked down the page.

#####   Catalogue Page
The catalogue page is a single column page and set to be full width on any device. It is subdivided into areas for current tracks, audio, video, and back catalogue. 
Local navigation links are at the top of the page encouraging users to click for content further down the page and not visible yet.
On smaller devices the items that appear across two columns, e.g. videos, become a single column for easier use.

#####   News Page
The news page is a single column page and set to be full width on any device. Each news piece may have a Read more link for the user to be taken to a page with more details or an external page. 

#####   Book us Page
The book us page uses standard Bootstrap 4 form components. 
First name and last name fields, are place side by side and each take up half the width of the form. 
Event Type and Date of Event fields, are place side by side and each take up half the width of the form.
On smaller devices these fields increase to take up the full width of the form.

All fields except the text area field: __Any other comments__, are required fields. The user is not permitted to successfully submit the form until these fields are completed correctly.
The user will receive feedback if the content is not suitable.
Empty required fields have the message: Please fill out this field.
In an attempt to stop fake email addresses from being submitted, the Email field will ensure that the email address follows conventional patterns where they must contain the @ symbol, etc.
The phone number field will only accept numbers and no letters.
The Event date uses a bootstrap datepicker where the user must choose a month then a day.

#####   CSS
Bootstrap 4 provides the fundamental CSS and JavaScript for the entire site.
However, custom styles have been created and a style.css file can be found in the assets/css directory.
Custom styles for each page, navigation, footer and media queries are grouped together.


<a name="style"></a>
#####   Typography
Google fonts: Raleway with sans serif as backup


#####   Colours
|Hex|rgba||
|:---|:---|:---|
|#ec1e2b|rgba(236, 30, 43)|Red|

<a name="deployment"></a>
### Deployment
GitHub is used to host the code and publish the pages.

A new repository was created in GitHub called: **project01-user-centric-frontend**

After a final Git Add and Git commit

``$git add .``

``$git commit -m "Final commit"``

The pages were pushed to the new GitHub repository

``$ git remote add origin https://github.com/Sonnerz/project01-user-centric-frontend``

``$ git push -u origin master``

``$Username``

``$Password``

Under the Settings – GitHub Pages of the new repository, the master branch of the code is published to the url: 

https://sonnerz.github.io/project01-user-centric-frontend/
