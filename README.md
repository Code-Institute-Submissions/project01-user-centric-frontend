##  Strategy Plane
Our goal at this stage of the project is to identify what the customer aims to achieve, what their business goals are, and in turn, the reason for a website.

The scope is fundamentally determined by the strategy of the site, so it is important we define a good strategy from the outset. This strategy incorporates not only the benefit to the owners of the site but also the benefit to the users.

We aim to:
*   determine the business objectives and the value of the website
*   use this plane to determine the reason for the websites existence
